# Hey and welcome to my profile 👋

I'm a recent Backend development graduate with a work background in carpentry and building regulations (not much correlation there, I know..). Two years ago I decided to change career paths and study Backend Development, and I haven't looked back! As a lover of problem-solving, I think I've chosen the right career 😅

I'm currently looking for my first professional role as a Developer and aim to fill this page with projects that demostrate my capabilities and willingness to learn!
